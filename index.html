            <p>
            My interest in accessibility stems from my mother and her side of the family, many of whom experience partial hearing loss, including her. <br>
            Growing up, I saw the challenges they faced in communication, from struggling to follow conversations in noisy settings to relying on captions and assistive devices. <br>
            These experiences made me aware of the barriers that exist for people with hearing impairments and inspired my passion for creating inclusive solutions. <br>
            I believe accessibility is essential for ensuring equal opportunities, and I am committed to advocating for tools and technologies that make communication more inclusive for everyone.
